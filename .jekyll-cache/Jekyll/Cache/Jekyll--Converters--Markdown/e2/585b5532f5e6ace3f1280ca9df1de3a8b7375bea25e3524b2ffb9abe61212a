      <p>Ground‚Äêmotion analysis of more than 3000 records from 59 earthquakes, including records from the March 2020 Mw¬†5.7 Magna earthquake sequence, was carried out to investigate site response and basin amplification in the Wasatch Front, Utah. We compare ground motions with the Bayless and Abrahamson (2019; hereafter, BA18) ground‚Äêmotion model (GMM) for Fourier amplitude spectra, which was developed on crustal earthquake records from California and other tectonically active regions. The Wasatch Front records show a significantly different near‚Äêsource rate of distance attenuation than the BA18 model, which we attribute to differences in (apparent) geometric attenuation. Near‚Äêsource residuals show a period dependence of this effect, with greater attenuation at shorter periods (T&lt;0.5\,‚Äâs) and a correlation between period and the distance over which the discrepancy manifests (‚àº20‚Äì50\,‚Äâkm). We adjusted the recorded ground motions for these regional path effects and solved for station site terms using linear mixed‚Äêeffects regressions, with groupings for events and stations. We analyzed basin amplification by comparing the site terms with the basin geometry and basin depths from two seismic‚Äêvelocity models for the region. Sites over the deeper parts of the sedimentary basins are amplified by factors of 3‚Äì10, relative to sites with thin sedimentary cover, with greater amplification at longer periods (T‚â≥1\,‚Äâs). Average ground‚Äêmotion variability increases with period, and long‚Äêperiod variability exhibits a slight increase at the basin edges. These results indicate regional seismic wave propagation effects requiring further study, and potentially a regionalized GMM, as well as highlight basin amplification complexities that may be incorporated into seismic hazard assessments.</p>

      <p>Earthquake hazards in the U.S. Pacific Northwest (PNW) are increased by the presence of deep sedimentary basins that amplify and prolong ground shaking. To better understand basin and site effects on ground motions, we compile a database of recordings from crustal and intraslab earthquakes. We process 8028 records with magnitudes from 3.5 to 6.8 and hypocentral depths up to 62¬†km to compute Fourier amplitude spectra of ground acceleration for frequencies of 0‚Äì20¬†Hz. We compute residuals relative to the Bayless and Abrahamson (2019; hereafter, BA18) ground‚Äêmotion model and perform a series of linear, crossed, mixed‚Äêeffects regressions. In addition to estimating the bias, event, and site terms, we incorporate groupings for broad regionalized site response in three different regions (Seattle basin, Puget Lowland, non‚ÄêPuget Lowland), for effects from seismotectonic regime (crustal and intraslab sources), and for interactions between the regions and seismotectonic regimes. We find that the scaling of site response with respect to VS30 (time‚Äêaveraged shear‚Äêwave velocity from the surface to a depth of 30¬†m) and to basin depth indicators Z1.0 and Z2.5 (depths to the 1.0 and 2.5¬†km/s shear‚Äêwave velocity horizons) is generally consistent with BA18; however, the region terms display strong spatial amplification patterns. For frequencies less than 5¬†Hz, the Seattle basin amplifies ground motions up to a factor of four, relative to the non‚ÄêPuget Lowland, with a maximum amplification around near 0.5¬†Hz. Sites in the Puget Lowland amplify low frequencies up to a factor of 2.5. At higher frequencies (f&gt;5\,‚ÄâHz), the Puget Lowland and Seattle basin show regional deamplification of ground motions, with the smallest average amplification factor of 0.65 occurring at 10.0¬†Hz. Although we observe slight differences in the seismotectonic regime terms, we find that the region terms are significantly more important for modeling earthquake hazard in the PNW.</p>

      <p>The selection and weighting of ground‚Äêmotion models (GMMs) introduces a significant source of uncertainty in U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) National Seismic Hazard Modeling Project (NSHMP) forecasts. In this study, we evaluate 18 candidate GMMs using instrumental ground‚Äêmotion observations of horizontal peak ground acceleration (PGA) and 5%‚Äêdamped pseudospectral acceleration (0.02‚Äì10¬†s) for tectonic earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, to inform logic‚Äêtree weights for the update of the USGS seismic hazard model for Hawaii. GMMs are evaluated using two methods. The first is a total residual visualization approach that compares the probability density function (PDF), mean and standard deviations œÉ, of the observed and predicted ground motion. The second GMM evaluation method we use is the common total residual probabilistic scoring method (log likelihood [LLH]). The LLH method provides a single score that can be used to weight GMMs in the Hawaii seismic hazard model logic trees. The total residual PDF approach provides additional information by preserving GMM over‚Äê and underprediction across a broad spectrum of periods that is not available from a single value LLH score. We apply these GMM evaluation methods to two different data sets: (1)¬†a database of instrumental ground motions from historic earthquakes in Hawaii from 1973 to 2007 (Mw¬†4‚Äì7.3) and (2) available ground motions from recent earthquakes (Mw¬†4‚Äì6.9) associated with 2018 Kilauea eruptions. The 2018 Kilauea sequence contains both volcanic eruptions and tectonic earthquakes allowing for statistically significant GMM comparisons of the two event classes. The Kilauea ground observations provide an independent data set allowing us to evaluate the predictive power of GMMs implemented in the new USGS nshmp‚Äêhaz software system. We evaluate GMM performance as a function of earthquake depth and we demonstrate that short‚Äêperiod volcanic eruption ground motions are not well predicted by any candidate GMMs. Nine of the initial 18 candidate GMMs fit the observed ground motions and meet established criteria for inclusion in the update of the Hawaii seismic hazard model. A weighted mean of four top performing GMMs in this study (NGAsubslab, NGAsubinter, ASK14, A10) is 50% lower for PGA than for GMMS used in the previous USGS seismic hazard model for Hawaii.</p>

      <p>We use a large instrumental dataset from the 2019 Ridgecrest earthquake sequence (Rekoske et¬†al., 2019, 2020) to examine repeatable source‚Äê, path‚Äê, and site‚Äêspecific ground motions. A mixed‚Äêeffects analysis is used to partition total residuals relative to the Boore et¬†al. (2014; hereafter, BSSA14) ground‚Äêmotion model. We calculate the Arias intensity stress drop for the earthquakes and find strong correlation with our event terms, indicating that they are consistent with source processes. We look for physically meaningful trends in the partitioned residuals and test the ability of BSSA14 to capture the behavior we observe in the data.We find that BSSA14 is a good match to the median observations for M&gt;4. However, we find bias for individual events, especially those with small magnitude and hypocentral depth‚â•7\,‚Äâkm, for which peak ground acceleration is underpredicted by a factor of 2.5. Although the site amplification term captures the median site response when all sites are considered together, it does not capture variations at individual stations across a range of site conditions. We find strong basin amplification in the Los Angeles, Ventura, and San Gabriel basins. We find weak amplification in the San Bernardino basin, which is contrary to simulation‚Äêbased findings showing a channeling effect from an event with a north‚Äìsouth azimuth. This and an additional set of ground motions from earthquakes southwest of Los Angeles suggest that there is an azimuth‚Äêdependent southern California basin response related to the orientation of regional structures when ground motion from waves traveling south‚Äìnorth are compared with those in the east‚Äìwest direction. These findings exhibit the power of large, spatially dense ground‚Äêmotion datasets and make clear that nonergodic models are a way to reduce bias and uncertainty in ground‚Äêmotion estimation for applications like the U.S. Geological Survey National Seismic Hazard Model and the ShakeAlert earthquake early warning System.</p>

      <p>Following the 2019 Ridgecrest, California, earthquake sequence, we compiled ground‚Äêmotion records from multiple data centers and processed these records using newly developed ground‚Äêmotion processing software that performs quality assurance checks, performs standard time series processing steps, and computes a wide range of ground‚Äêmotion metrics. In addition, we compute station and waveform metrics such as the time‚Äêaveraged shear‚Äêwave velocity to 30¬†m depth (VS30), finite‚Äêrupture distances, and spectral accelerations. This data set includes 22,708 records from 133 events from 4 July 2019 (UTC) to 18 October 2019 with a magnitude range from 3.6 to 7.1. We expect that the rapid collection and dissemination of this information will facilitate detailed studies of these ground motions. In this article, we describe the data selection, processing steps, and how to access the data.</p>

      <p>Instrumental ground‚Äêmotion recordings from the 2018 Anchorage, Alaska (Mw¬†7.1), earthquake sequence provide an independent data set allowing us to evaluate the predictive power of ground‚Äêmotion models (GMMs) for intraslab earthquakes associated with the Alaska subduction zone. In this study, we evaluate 15 candidate GMMs using instrumental ground‚Äêmotion observations of peak ground acceleration and 5% damped pseudospectral acceleration (0.02‚Äì10¬†s) to inform logic‚Äêtree weights for the update of the U.S. Geological Survey seismic hazard model for Alaska. GMMs are evaluated using two methods. The first is a total residual visualization approach that compares the probability density function, mean, and standard deviations œÉ of the observed and predicted ground motion. The second GMM evaluation method we use is the common total residual probabilistic scoring method (log likelihood [LLH]). The LLH method provides a single score that can be used to weight GMMs in the Alaska seismic hazard model logic trees. To test logic branches in previous seismic hazard models, we evaluate GMM performance as a function of depth and we demonstrate that some GMMs show improved performance for earthquakes with focal depths greater than 50¬†km. Ten of the initial 15 candidate GMMs fit the observed ground motions and meet established criteria for inclusion in the next update of the Alaska seismic hazard model.</p>

      <p>We measure pseudospectral and peak ground motions from 44 intermediate‚Äêdepth Mw‚â•4.9 earthquakes in the Cook Inlet region of southern Alaska, including those from the 2018 Mw¬†7.1 earthquake near Anchorage, to identify regional amplification features (0.1‚Äì5\,‚Äâs period). Ground‚Äêmotion residuals are computed with respect to an empirical ground‚Äêmotion model for intraslab subduction earthquakes, and we compute bias, between‚Äê, and within‚Äêevent terms through a linear mixed‚Äêeffects regression. Between‚Äêevent residuals are analyzed to assess the relative source characteristics of the Cook Inlet earthquakes and suggest a difference in the scaling of the source with depth, relative to global observations. The within‚Äêevent residuals are analyzed to investigate regional amplification, and various spatial patterns manifest, including correlations of amplification with depth of the Cook Inlet basin and varying amplifications east and west of the center of the basin. Three earthquake clusters are analyzed separately and indicate spatial amplification patterns that depend on source location and exhibit variations in the depth scaling of long‚Äêperiod basin amplification. The observations inform future seismic hazard modeling efforts in the Cook Inlet region. More broadly, they suggest a greater complexity of basin and regional amplification than is currently used in seismic hazard analyses.</p>
