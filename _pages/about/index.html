<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <p>Hello! I am a geophysics Ph.D. candidate at Scripps Institution of Oceanography, UC San Diego. As a seismologist, I currently work with <a href="https://algabriel.scrippsprofiles.ucsd.edu/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Alice-Agnes Gabriel</a> and <a href="https://dmay.scrippsprofiles.ucsd.edu/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Dave May</a> on reduced-order modeling techniques for simulating earthquake ground motion and understanding source physics. More generally, I am interested in understanding earthquake source mechanics and the propagation of seismic waves, with a focus on seismic hazard and earthquake early warning. In my research, I use hybrid (physics-based coupled with machine learning) models, high-performance computing, and other emerging technologies (e.g., distributed acoustic sensing) to better understand and mitigate earthquake hazard.</p> <p>Previously, I worked as a Pathways Intern at the U.S. Geological Survey where I helped to develop the <a href="https://ghsc.code-pages.usgs.gov/esi/groundmotion-processing/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">USGS Automated Ground Motion Processing Software</a>. I also constructed databases of earthquake ground motion in the <a href="https://doi.org/10.5066/P9BUCRF7" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Pacific Northwest</a>, <a href="https://doi.org/10.5066/P9REBW60" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">California</a>, <a href="https://doi.org/10.5066/P9Y491AY" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Alaska</a> and <a href="https://doi.org/10.5066/P9VXB1U6" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Hawaii</a>, which have helped to inform the earthquake hazard in those regions. As an undergraduate at Colorado School of Mines, I worked with <a href="https://ebrucsm.wordpress.com" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Ebru Bozdag</a> on global seismological problems to probe the physical properties of the Earthâ€™s outer core and mantle with numerical seismic wave simulations.</p> </body></html>
