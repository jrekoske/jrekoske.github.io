Hello! I am a geophysics Ph.D. candidate at Scripps Institution of Oceanography, UC San Diego. I currently work with [Alice-Agnes Gabriel](https://algabriel.scrippsprofiles.ucsd.edu/) and [Dave May](https://dmay.scrippsprofiles.ucsd.edu/) on reduced-order modeling techniques for simulating earthquake ground motion and understanding source physics. More generally, I am interested in understanding earthquake source mechanics and the propagation of seismic waves, with a focus on seismic hazard and earthquake early warning. In my research, I use hybrid (physics-based coupled with machine learning) models, high-performance computing, and other emerging technologies (e.g., distributed acoustic sensing) to better understand and mitigate earthquake hazard.

Previously, I worked as a Pathways Intern at the U.S. Geological Survey where I helped to develop the [USGS Automated Ground Motion Processing Software](https://ghsc.code-pages.usgs.gov/esi/groundmotion-processing/). I also constructed databases of earthquake ground motion in the [Pacific Northwest](https://doi.org/10.5066/P9BUCRF7), [California](https://doi.org/10.5066/P9REBW60), [Alaska](https://doi.org/10.5066/P9Y491AY) and [Hawaii](https://doi.org/10.5066/P9VXB1U6), which have helped to inform the earthquake hazard in those regions. As an undergraduate at Colorado School of Mines, I worked with [Ebru Bozdag](https://ebrucsm.wordpress.com) on global seismological problems to probe the physical properties of the Earth's outer core and mantle with numerical seismic wave simulations.

Please feel free to contact me via e-mail.
